# Laptop Price Predictor

I've created an app on Heroku to get the price prediction for laptops with user given configurations.

This is a regression problem and I've used many regression algorithms including AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, VotingRegression as well as Stacking. However `RandomForestRegression` came out as best option on basis of r2_score & MAE metrics.


If you've any questions related to Heroku deployment, you can check the Heroku documentation page.
